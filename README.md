This is the 'Typing Speed Tester' project for the undergraduate-level Programming for Scientific Computing course.

Libraries used:-
1. Tkinter - It is used for building a Graphic User Interface (GUI) based application.
2. random - This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.
3. timeit - This module provides a simple way to time small bits of Python code.
4. difflib – It provides classes and functions for comparing sequences.
5. Pillow (PIL) which is also called the Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to the Python interpreter.
6. datetime – This module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times

Features:- 
1. Tricky Spelling – Challenge yourself with a test filled with tricky words, sure to make your fingers fumble.
